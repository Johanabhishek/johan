 One Size Fits None: I Tested Data Augmentation on 3 Diverse Datasets. Here's What I Found.
Posted: August 11, 2025

In my last post, I shared a surprising finding: for a standard time series dataset, some of the most popular data augmentation techniques actually hurt my model's performance. It was a clear sign that the common wisdom of "just add augmentation" is a risky game of trial-and-error.

But was that just a fluke? A quirk of one specific dataset? To be sure, I knew I had to scale up the experiment. I needed to move from a simple test to a rigorous, scientific benchmark to see if this problem was a universal one.

The Proving Grounds: Three Worlds of Data
To test for generalizability, I chose three datasets from completely different real-world domains, each with its own unique character:

Energy Data: Smooth and highly cyclical, showing daily patterns of household energy use.

Yahoo Server Metrics: Highly imbalanced, with rare anomaly events making up less than 0.4% of the data.

KPI Data: Sparse and volatile, characterized by sharp, sudden spikes in system performance metrics.

On top of that, I upgraded my evaluation process to the gold standard: 5-fold cross-validation. This ensures the results are stable, reliable, and not just a lucky roll of the dice.

The Experiment: The Hermes Gauntlet
I used my custom-built search tool, Hermes, to run an automated search for the best augmentation policy on each of the three datasets. The goal was to see if a "one-size-fits-all" strategy exists, or if each dataset would require its own unique solution.

The Overwhelming Evidence: The Villain is Real
The results were unambiguous and even more powerful than I expected. Here is the final summary of the best-performing policy found for each dataset after a random search:

Dataset

Best Policy Found

Score (Mean Accuracy)

Energy

baseline

83.03%

Yahoo

baseline

99.64%

KPI

permutation + jittering + time_warping

99.60%

(Note: The high accuracy on the Yahoo dataset is due to its extreme imbalance; even the baseline is very high.)

The key finding is stunning. For two of the three completely different datasets, the best strategy Hermes could find in a random search was to do nothing at all. For the third, it found a complex, non-obvious combination of three different techniques.

This is the most powerful evidence I could have asked for. It proves that the "Trial-and-Error Pipeline" is a fundamental and dangerous problem in data-centric AI. The optimal augmentation strategy is clearly, demonstrably data-dependent.

The Conclusion
This experiment moves my conviction from a hypothesis to a data-backed certainty. We cannot build robust and reliable AI systems if we are still guessing about how to prepare our data.

This is why the mission of Project Hermes—to build an intelligent tool that can find the right strategy for the right data, every time—is so critical. The next phase of my work will focus on moving beyond random search to more intelligent optimization algorithms.

The problem is real. The mission is clear. The build continues.
